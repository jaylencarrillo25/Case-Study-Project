    <h2>The System Wasn't Built for Everyone</h2>
    <p>
        Algorithmic credit scoring affects many parts of life, including loans, housing, insurance, and jobs.
        These systems use historical data that has been shaped by decades of racial discrimination, which continues
        to create cycles of inequality for communities of color.

    <h2>How Credit Scoring Works</h2>
    <p>
        Credit scoring systems use your financial data to decide things like loan approvals, interest rates, insurance rates, and even job opportunities.
        However, the data they rely on is often shaped by existing inequalities.
        This means your score can reflect more than just your financial behavior.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What goes in:</strong> Your credit history, the types of loans youâ€™ve used, your payment records, your lender, and even your zip code.</p>
    <p><strong>What comes out:</strong> A credit score that affects your ability to get a loan, rent a home, get insured, or find a job.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that these scores don't just reflect your actions, they can reflect biased systems and unequal access to financial services.</p>
